# ResNet (Residual Neural Network)


*Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to
ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously.*

## Usage:

```
from resnet.ResNet import ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50, ResNet101, ResNet152

model = ResNet18()
model
```
